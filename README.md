# prune-exports
A small utility to prune workspace migration resources generated by databrickslabs/migrate

Basic Usage:
`pruneExport.py --source <path/to/export/directory> --target <path/to/new/directory> --tags tag1 tag2 tag3`

Inputs:
`--source` is the folder exported from `migrate`; this folder should contain all of the log files and folders generated by that script. In default setups, this folder will have the session token of the last pipeline run.

`--target` is the destination folder. New files and folders will be written here. It does not have to pre-exist.

`--tags` is a space-separated list of tags to parse. These should be in the form of `team_x`, to meet expected naming conventions.

Additional options:
```
--skip-metastore: skips copying the metastore from source to dest.
--skip-artifacts: skips copying the artifacts folder from source to dest.
--overwrite: overwrites destination files/folders if they already exist.
```
